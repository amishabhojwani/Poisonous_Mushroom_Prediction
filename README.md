# Mushrooms are fun (but deadly)
This project is the source code for the project presented in [this blogpost](https://amishabhojwani.github.io/posts/2022/03-mushrooms).

The code directory has a notebook called `Mushies_demo.ipynb` that walks you through the project and calls the file from the data directory. The other notebooks are for data visualisation and additional analyses.
