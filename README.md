# Mushrooms are fun (but deadly)

## 1. Introduction
This is a project built during the [Digital Futures Data Science Academy](https://digitalfutures.com/). The aims were to use class predictive modelling to determine if a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on a minimum number of biological traits. The dataset used is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification) and on this repository under the `Data` directory.

## 2. Code
The source code for the models is in the `Code` directory and a walkthrough of it is available in [this blogpost](https://amishabhojwani.github.io/posts/2022/03-mushrooms).The main notebook is called `Mushies_demo.ipynb` and holds code for final models. Other notebooks are for data visualisation and additional analyses, the outputs of which are imported to the main notebook.

## 3. Dependencies
This project was built with `Python 3.9` in a Jupyter notebook. I recommend starting an Anaconda environment with the following libraries installed: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, `MatplotLib` and `scikit-learn`.
